## Description
This project will be using Pandas and Faker to create dataframes.
This isn't intended to be full blown data science project.
The goal here is to come up with some question and then see what API or
datasets you can use to get the information needed to answer that question.

## What my project is about
I decided for this project, I wanted to see how much area each country has.
I.e, I wanted to show the area of all the countries in the world.

## Pip install instructions
In order to install all of the files necessary for the program,
please run the following:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
By running this line you should  be able to execute the program.

## How to run
In a terminal window, please type the following:
```
python main.py
```
This will run the main python program.
